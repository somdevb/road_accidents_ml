## Project Description:

An Accident is an event that happens by chance or that is without apparent or deliberate cause.

Road Accidents: Are they seriously accidents? No, most road accidents follow a pattern and where there is a pattern there is a way to prevent it.

Our main objective is to build an application that can "Prevent Road Accidents" and "Report an accident to the nearest rescue team". We do this by studying patterns from some datasets that are available at our disposal. For this project specifically, we used Traffic Accident Data of the USA, available on Kaggle.

We went on and studied the dataset, analyzed the patterns, and found out that the majority of the road accidents, on city-level take place in certain locations, which we called 'Accidental Hotspots'. These areas may be a junction, crossroads, or even freeways where there has been a large number of accidents lately. This is analyzed by the usage of several Deep Learning Algorithms, Clustering and Fishing Algorithms. The accidental hotspots thus identified, can then be used by urban planners, city workers, lawmakers, and most importantly the commuter, to make his commute safer and thereby make the city a better place to live. The accidental hotspot system will trigger the subconscious mind of the commuter, as we send him/her a trigger message that he is near an accident-prone zone. This will help prevent accidents. It will also help city planners and lawmakers to assign and assist the police force across the major parts of the city. They can thereby make sure that there is enough force in the form of Police Vehicles, PCR Vans, Ambulances, and Firetrucks available at all times at the accidental hotspot.

We know that in this day and age, data is a highly valued resource. Especially when it comes down to open-source data. So, we actually went on and made an option for the user to make an entry for an accident he witnessed, thereby contributing to a crowd-funding based dataset. Also, we can go on and send this data to the city planner, in order to get his thoughts and ideas about how to proceed.
